Angvir Oldbeard is the head of [House Oldbeard](/great-houses/house-oldbeard). He is an old man, experienced in battle and with the scars to prove it. He was a mentor for Regent Ironwood growing up. His sons often fight and bicker; many are concerned one of the younger ones may try to claim the stewardship when Angvir dies.
