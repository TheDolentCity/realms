## Members
Angvir Oldbeard is the current steward. His husband is dead, but he has four sons who will outlive him.

### Angvir Oldbeard
He is an old man, experienced in battle and with the scars to prove it. He was a mentor for Regent Ironwood growing up. His sons often fight and bicker; many are concerned one of the younger ones may try to claim the stewardship.

### Erik Oldbeard
The oldest son. Responsible. Honorable. Tall and royal-looking.

### Leif Oldbeard
The loudest son. Baudy. Prone to drinking.

### Gunnar Oldbeard
The strongest son. Prone to seducing men and women of the court.

### Yvngi Oldbeard
The youngest son. The boldest and most handsome. Killed his first man at the age of ten. Some say there is evil in his heart and he is best avoided.
