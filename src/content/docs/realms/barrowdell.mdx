##### Ruled by [House Ulfrar](/great-houses/house-ulfrar).

Barrowdell is a central region with a cold and wet climate. House Ulfrar has a long history of attacking neighboring realms or orchestrating raids that are later denounced for appearances sake. The realm is filled with mercenaries who believe [The Cairn Eternal](/setting/religion#the-cairn-eternal) has bestowed them with the divine right to pillage other realms. Thieves, highwaymen, and other criminals are forced into the army with the threat of death.
