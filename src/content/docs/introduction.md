****Realms**** is an epistolary, play-by-post, faction-focused, roleplaying game. Players take on the role of a Regent, the leader of a great house that may one day be King. Until that day, it is their duty to increase the stature of their house and the health of their realm. But be careful, rivals and stewards of minor houses may plot for your family's demise.

The primary method of play is [writing secret letters](/rules/writing-letters) to other regents and stewards. Alliances are the most powerful resource. A great house under siege may request the aid of another's army to survive.

This is a game where any form of diplomacy, courtship, or intrigue is possible. You want to dam a river to starve a rival house? You want to woo and marry a rival steward to unify your two houses? You want to create a new religion to beguile the masses? All, and more, are possible.
