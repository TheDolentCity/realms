title: Regent Checks
description: The descriptions for each regent's stats used in the game.
---

Sometimes we use dice to determine outcomes for a regent. For example, a regent will need to roll romance to woo a lover. Each regent has several stats rated from 1-100. When a regent check is called for, a d100 is rolled and if the result is less than the stat, the check is successful. If a regent's romance is 34, then they have a 34% chance of success for a romance check.

## Stats
Every regent has several stats. These abstract away things like your skills at speechcraft, history, plots, and battle. A regent with high stats is very exceptional, even if their realm is not.

### Diplomacy
This represents your skill at managing relationships with allies and enemies. High diplomacy is useful for avoiding war or seeking trade.

### Education
This represents your knowledge of the world. High education is useful for historical precidents, knowing your enemy, and more.

### Honor
This represents your house's history at honoring oaths and debts. High honor is useful in any sort of negotation or swearing of oaths.

### Intrigue
This represents your ability to deceive, hide, and trick. High intrigue is useful when you don't want others to know who you're moving against.

### Romance
This represents your charisma and general attraction. High romance is useful for finding a partner and can influence the weak-minded.

### Warfare
This represents your skill at war. High warfare has no use outside of battle, sieges, and pillaging.
