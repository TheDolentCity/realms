title: Regent Checks

Sometimes we use dice to determine outcomes for a regent. For example, a regent will need to roll romance to woo a lover. Each regent has several stats rated from 1-100. When a regent check is called for, a d100 is rolled and if the result is less than the stat, the check is successful. If a regent's romance is 34, then they have a 34% chance of success for a romance check.
