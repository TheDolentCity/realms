Sometimes we use dice to determine outcomes for a realm. For example, an unloyal populice may stage a coup. Each realm has several stats rated from 1-100. When a realm check is called for, a d100 is rolled and if the result is less than the stat, the check is successful. If a realm's loyalty is 84, then they have an 84% chance of success for a loyalty check.
