title: Realm Checks
description: The descriptions for each realm's stats used in the game.
---

Sometimes we use dice to determine outcomes for a realm. For example, an unloyal populice may stage a coup. Each realm has several stats rated from 1-100. When a realm check is called for, a d100 is rolled and if the result is less than the stat, the check is successful. If a realm's morale is 84, then they have an 84% chance of success for a morale check.

## Stats
Every realm has several stats. These abstract away things like happiness, religious devotion, food, and wealth. A realm with high stats is very powerful.

### Army
This represents the strength of the realm's army. High army is useful for winning battles and executing sieges during times of war.

### Crime
This represents the prevelance of crime in the region. High crime is bad for food and resources, low crime has no downsides.

### Defenses
This represents the defenses for the realm's cities and villages. High defenses is useful for warfare, low defenses makes warfare dangerous.

### Food
This represents the population's food stores and daily subsistence. High food keeps morale high, low food is dangerous and can decrease almost every other stat.

### Health
This represents the population's health. High health is useful for morale and warfare, low health leads to a decrease in population.

### Morale
This represents the general happiness and loyalty of the populace. High morale is useful for resisting negative events, low morale makes certain negative events more likely.

### Navy
This represents the strength of the realm's navy. High navy is useful for controlling sea trade and ports during times of war.

### Population
This represents the size of the populace. High population is useful for warfare and trade, low population is only good when resources are low.

### Resources
This represents a combination of every resource for a populace that isn't food or wealth. It is useful for most large scale projects such as building a port town or arming troops for war.

### Reverance
This represents how religious the populace is and how devoted they are to the religion's tenets. High reverance is useful for morale and controlling the populace, low reverance is bad for morale.

### Trade
This represents the trading routes and agreements the realm has in place. High trade is useful for food, resources, and wealth. Low trade makes many resources hard to come by.

### Wealth
This represents the wealth of the realm. High wealth is useful for anything, as long as you're willing to part with the coin.

## Delta Stats
Each realm has several delta stats. These represent the extreme advantages and disadvantages of a region. Each turn, the realm's stats increase or decrease based on their deltas. These are usually small, 1-3%.

A realm may have the following delta stats:
- Wealth +3
- Trade +1
- Food -2
- Crime +2

This realm would have significant access to resources and wealth, but struggle to feed their people and quash crime rings.

## Burg Checks
These operate the same exact way as a Realm Check, but instead of representing an entire realm, it only represents a burg. Burgs are seats of power for minor houses, like Stormport or Rockmire.
