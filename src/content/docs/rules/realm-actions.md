description: A list of the various realm actions a regent can take in the game.
---

Regents can perform one realm action on their turn. These actions take time and resources, represented by action tokens. Most realm actions only cost one action token, but some cost several as they require months of planning to get right.

## Make a Decree (1)
This is any new general decree or rule for the realm you rule over. It can affect almost any in-game statistic. Here are a few examples:
- Imposing new taxes to increase [Wealth](/rules/realm-checks#wealth), but decrease [Morale](/rules/realm-checks#morale)
- Throwing a festival or tournament to increase [Morale](/rules/realm-checks#morale), but decrease [Wealth](/rules/realm-checks#wealth)
- Arrests and crackdowns to decrease [Crime](/rules/realm-checks#crime)

## Invoke Religious Doctrine (1)
Sway the opinion of your realm by invoking religious doctrine. A reverance check will be necessary. Here are a few examples:
- In a realm where the Great Beasts are worshipped, you could state there has been an omen and the realm must march to war.

## Host a Council (1)
Invite any number of regents or minor rulers to your realm for a council. A diplomacy check is necessary for each NPC that would not want to attend. Those who agree to visit can bring a retinue of no more than ten unless they wish to spend a realm token to attend. If an invited guest is significantly far away, they must spend realm tokens to travel (number determined by GM).

Out of game, when a council occurs the players and GM schedule a time to have a voice call in discord. Anything discussed in this voice call cannot be spied upon by any other character. The council should occur before the end of the next turn.

## Attend a Council (variable)
Most of the time when you attend a council, there is no realm token cost. But if you must travel a significant distance, the GM may require you to spend realm tokens to do so.

## Court a Partner (2)
Attempt to woo an NPC or PC. This is a Romance check for the regent. A wooed NPC may be infatuated with you, but still not wish to marry you or abandon something more important to them. This may mean they make an honor or loyalty check to determine their next steps.

A wooed PC does not need to take any action, but this should impact their motivations and roleplay.

> *Consent is important for anything romantic or sexual. Do not write anything in a letter or perform any action that would make someone in real life uncomfortable without first explicitly getting their approval. If either party is uncomfortable with something that occurs please speak to the GM.*

You may choose to woo someone who is not of a great or minor house, in which case a success automatically results in a marriage.

## Conceive a Child (1)
Make a health check. On a failure, there was a miscarriage. Otherwise, in nine turns, you or your partner will conceive a child. There is a 1% chance of death when this occurs.

## Construction (variable)
Propose a large construction project, such as a road, a castle, or several ships. This may increase realm stats, such as trade, defenses, or navy, but will always cost a significant amount of resources and may cost several realm tokens as well.

## Trade (1)
Engage in diplomacy and trade with existing trade routes. This usually requires a trade check. The degree of success will determine how much food, resources, and wealth you gain.

## Intrigue (1)
This is a special action you can take to obscure any other action. This increases the cost of the real action by +1.

When the realm update is posted it will appear as if you did not perform an action or it will appear like you made another action of your choice (like a decree or construction project). You do not gain the benefits of the "fake" action.

## Assassination (3)
Plan an assassination. Based on the plan, the GM will assign the chance of success. If you do not perform an intrigue action to obscure this action, everyone will know you were the one who performed the assassination.

If you do perform an intrigue action to obscure the assassination, then the GM will also assign a chance of success that you are discovered based on your plan.

## Spy (1)
Choose a regent or steward and make an intrigue check. On a success, you may intercept and read any letters from them at the end of the turn. If you wish, you may destroy them or pass them along.

If you destroy any letters, they will eventually hear (1-3 turns) that word did not reach their intended recipient.

## Undermine (1)
Choose a realm you would like to influence. This could mean decreasing reverance with unholy speeches, increasing crime with smuggled goods, or anything else you can imagine to sabotage the realm. An intrigue check may be necessary.

## Muster Troops (1)
Muster troops for war. This action must be taken before the battle, pillage, or siege action can be performed. Mustering troops will decrease morale, resources, and wealth.

## Battle (1)
You must perform the muster troops action before this can be performed. Engage another army, navy, or foe in warfare. Both sides must provide the GM with their battle strategy and then the GM will make whatever realm checks or regent checks they think necessary to perform the battle and determine the outcome.

Only the side that initiates the battle must spend an action token on it.

## Pillage (1)
You must perform the muster troops action before this can be performed. Engage civilians with your army or navy. This is devastating for the realm you attack, but will impact your honor and possibly the morale of your allies.

## Siege (1)
You must perform the muster troops action before this can be performed. Engage a fortress or castle in a siege. This may transition into a battle if either side wishes to, otherwise the action has no immediate outcome. The realm that is sieged quickly loses food, health, morale, and population until the siege ends.

The siege ends when the besieged surrender or the regent leading the siege does not spend their action on the siege.
