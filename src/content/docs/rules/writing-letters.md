title: Writing Letters
description: Rules and suggestions for writing letters to other characters.
---

Regents can write letters to any other regent or steward, whether they're controlled by a player or not. These letters are freeform, there are *no* rules about what can or cannot be in a letter. You do not even have to send any letters on your turn if you don't want to.

The only rules are as follows:
- Send your letters to the Game Master, never to another player.
- Please send your letters before the end of the turn.
