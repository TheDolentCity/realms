## Tragedy
Someone close to the regent dies. It is an accident or random stroke of bad luck.

## Uprising
Some minor aristocrats and members of the public are unhappy with your rule. They try to overtake the realm's seat of power.

## New Rival
A charismatic, political figure has gained some notoriety in the realm's court or as an officer in the army/navy. They disagree with many of your decisions. Their influence will grow over time, but arresting or killing them will earn the eternal hatred of their followers.

## Natural Disaster
A famine, plague, wildfire, storm, earthquake, or other horrible natural disaster. This has huge impacts on food, resources, health, population, and morale.

## Feud
A squabble between lower aristocrats has turned violent. Both sides demand blood. If nothing is done, a small war could break out within the realm.

## Holiday
A local holiday or traditional festival must be held in the realm. Morale and reverance increase, as food, resources, and wealth decrease. 

## Outlaw Activity
A band of outlaws have grown in recent times. They attempt to rob all trade and travelers along the realm's trade roads and shipping lanes.

## Trade Dispute
Tensions and sporadic conflicts have grown along a trade route. If diplomacy fails, trade will not continue along that route until negotiations are made. Food, resources, and wealth decrease.

## Trade Bounty
A potential surplus of several goods leads to an increase in food, resources, and wealth for everyone involved.

## Nothing of Note
Nothing notable occurs.
