One realm event is rolled for each realm at the end of each turn. These events can increase or decrease stats, require checks, or inflict horrible events such as famine or family deaths.

## Tragedy (1)
Someone close to the regent dies. It is an accident or random stroke of bad luck.

## Natural Disaster (2)
A famine, plague, wildfire, storm, earthquake, or other horrible natural disaster. This has huge impacts on food, resources, health, population, and morale.
