This is a brief overview of the game rules. See each linked page for more detailed information.

## Turns
A turn measures time in and out of game. The recommendation is that a turn lasts two tweeks of real world time and represents about a month of in-game time. Three turns is a season. 

At the start of each turn, players receive letters and one action token. On their turn, players can write as many letters as they wish to any regent or steward and perform one [realm action](/rules/realm-actions).

## Realm Updates
Once the Game Master has received all of the letters and actions from players, they craft a realm update. When the realm update is posted a new turn begins. Everything in the realm update is public and includes the following information:
- A new [realm event](/rules/realm-events). One is rolled every update.
- A list of [realm actions](/rules/realm-actions) taken by regents and their outcomes. Some realm actions can fail and some may not even be public.
- Updates to [realm stats](/rules/realm-checks#stats), such as Wealth or Morale, are public but not explicitly listed.

## [Realm Actions](/rules/realm-actions)
Regents can perform various realm actions, such as making decrees, wooing lovers, or mustering troops for war. These actions take time and resources, represented by action tokens. Most realm actions only cost one action token, but some cost several as they require months of planning to get right.

## [Realm Checks](/rules/realm-checks)
Sometimes we use dice to determine outcomes for a realm. For example, an unloyal populice may stage a coup. Each realm has several stats rated from 1-100. When a realm check is called for, a d100 is rolled and if the result is less than the stat, the check is successful. If a realm's loyalty is 84, then they have an 84% chance of success for a loyalty check.

## [Regent Checks](/rules/regent-checks)
Sometimes we use dice to determine outcomes for a regent. For example, a regent will need to roll romance to woo a lover. Each regent has several stats rated from 1-100. When a regent check is called for, a d100 is rolled and if the result is less than the stat, the check is successful. If a regent's romance is 34, then they have a 34% chance of success for a romance check.

## [Writing Letters](/rules/writing-letters)
Regents can write letters to any other regent or steward, whether they're controlled by a player or not. These letters are freeform, there are *no* rules about what can or cannot be in a letter. You do not even have to send any letters on your turn if you don't want to.

The only rules are as follows:
- Send your letters to the Game Master, never to another player.
- Please send your letters before the end of the turn.
