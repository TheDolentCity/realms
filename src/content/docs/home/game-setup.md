# Create a Regent
When you create a regent you must decide on a first name, gender, and age. Your age impacts your regent stats, your relationships, and your heirs.

## Age
There are three ages to choose from: young, mature, and old. Your age has a huge impact on what the people of Westmark expect from you.

### Mature
