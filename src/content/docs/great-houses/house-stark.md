It is one of the oldest lines of Westerosi nobility by far, claiming a line of descent stretching back over eight thousand years. Before Aegon's Conquest, as well as during the War of the Five Kings and early on in the Last War, the leaders of House Stark ruled over the region as the Kings in the North.
