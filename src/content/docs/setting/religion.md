## The Great Beasts
This religion believes in many unnamed nature gods who walk in the form of the animals of this world. Their followers believe they provide insight, power, and prophecy in times of crisis.

Worshipers of the Great Beasts do not have rituals, holy texts, priests, or large structures for worship. Instead they practice meditation in the solitude of the wilds. There is no ceremony for this, whatever words, dreams, or fears one shares with the Great Beasts are decided by oneself.

There are taboos however. If one kills or disrespects an animal that a Great Beast walks in, then doom comes for them.

The appearance of certain animals is treated as prophecy. A raven at night means someone has died. A red fox in snow means blood will be spilled. Wise folk often interpret these omens for regents and stewards.
