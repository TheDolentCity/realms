Dates are notated in BU (before unification) and AU (after unification). The present day is 289 AU. Much of history was lost during the invasion from Eastmark. It is known simply that at one point Westmark and Eastmark were unified as one kingdom.

## 10 BU - The Eastmark Invasion
The relationship between Eastmark and Westmark prior to the invasion is unknown. All that is known is that in autumn of 10 BU, Eastmark invaded with an army larger than the sum of the armies of the great houses of Westmark.

Misthaven was the first to fall and Northstar castle was destroyed. House Aven was blamed for being too relaxed on watching the borderland. This grudge continues to this day.

By 2 BU, every realm north of Fairfield had fallen or was under active siege. This led the final free houses to have a great council, despite the enmity they had for each other. Several heads of northern houses who escaped Eastmark forces also attended. This council resulted in the unification of the nine realms. 

## 0 AU - Unification of the Nine Realms
To survive the invasion of Eastmark, the great and minor houses alike put aside their differences and created one army under one King, Cassandra Imperion of Fairfield. Marching from Dawnstone, one by one their forces retook each realm and their seats of power.

## 2 AU - Defeat of Eastmark
Two years after unification, every realm but Misthaven had been retaken. The landbridge to the east was at that time a cold steppe. The King of Westmark marched her forces across the steppe, intent on driving the Eastmark army back across the landbridge. The fighting was so great and so muddy that the land was rendered a foggy marsh. Some legends even report that the landbridge between the two continents sundered and the earth fell into the ocean and was swept away.

In the midst of battle, the King of Westmark clashed swords with the King of Eastmark. Their duel was long and arduous. King Cassandra drove her sword into the King of Eastmark's eye, but the eastern King's last blow severed Cassandra's left arm. 

The Eastmark forces fled when their king fell and King Cassandra's advisors gathered around her as she lay dying from her mortal wound. As her last act, she declared that the crown would not pass to her own heir. Instead it would pass to the enemy of her house, the Percy Ashcroft of the Flooded Vale. Cassandra also declared that upon the death of the next king, the crown must pass to a different great house.

A thick fog descended on the marshy landbridge after the battle. It is believed that any future invasions would find it almost impossible to navigate the fog, and no easterners have been seen since this day.
