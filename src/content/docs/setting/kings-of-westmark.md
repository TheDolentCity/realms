## 0 AU - Cassandra of House Imperion
The first king of Westmark, great unifier of the nine realms of Westmark. Died in battle defeating the King of Eastmark two years after the unification. Respected by all the peoples of Westmark.

## 2 AU - Percy of House Ashcroft
Appointed by Cassandra, the first king of Westmark. Disliked by many for his strict and conservative approach to the laws of Westmark. Dutifully passed the crown to another great house instead of his heirs, as many feared he would do instead.

## 53 AU - Haybar of House Moxton
Appointed and ascended the throne at the young age of 18. There were some who opposed this decision, but he proved an honorable man with fair judgement. No great deeds or ill works to his name.

## 119 AU - Ellain of House Langloom
Appointed by Haybar on his death bed, Ellain vowed to restore the Realms of Westmark to a place of plenty like it was prior to the invasion of Eastmark. She diminished her own house's power to spread food across the realms.

## 166 AU - Vexenya of House Imperion
Appointed by King Ellain, rumors spread that the two of them had secreted their affair for many years. Vexenya never acknowledged the allegations. She did however share a close bond with House Langloom and declared Aethandran, Ellain's grandson, as heir to the throne.

## 225 AU - Aethandran of House Langloom
His appointment was controversial. Many rulers of great and minor houses protested the crown returning to House Langloom so quickly, but there were no laws to prevent such a decision. However, Ellain's efforts to feed the realms quieted much animosity.

## 272 AU - Tarvaxian of House Imperion
Another controversy, Tarvaxian was appointed at the old age of 61 when there were many other regents of great houses who were healthier. Again, House Langloom had passed the crown to House Imperion. Many regents grew concerned over this decision.

Concern great to nearly rebellious rage when Tarvaxian, against the advice of counsel, appointed Erendell Langloom, his young daughter's fiance, as heir to the throne.
